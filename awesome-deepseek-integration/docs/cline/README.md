## Key Features of Cline

1. **Agentic Coding with Claude 3.5 Sonnet**: Cline leverages advanced AI capabilities to handle complex software development tasks step-by-step, going beyond simple code completion or tech support.

2. **File and Project Management**: Cline can create, edit, and explore files within large projects, enabling seamless navigation and modification of codebases.

3. **Terminal Integration**: With user permission, Cline can execute terminal commands and monitor their output, allowing it to react dynamically to issues like dev server errors.

4. **Browser Automation**: For web development, Cline can launch sites in a headless browser, interact with pages (click, type, scroll), and capture screenshots and console logs to debug runtime errors and visual bugs.

5. **Human-in-the-Loop Safety**: Every file change and terminal command requires user approval via a GUI, ensuring a secure and controlled environment for exploring agentic AI capabilities.

6. **Context-Aware Assistance**: Cline analyzes file structures, source code ASTs, and runs regex searches to understand existing projects, ensuring efficient and relevant assistance without overwhelming the context window.

7. **Proactive Error Handling**: Cline monitors linter/compiler errors and proactively fixes issues like missing imports and syntax errors during file editing.

8. **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Cline can extend its own capabilities by creating new tools using the MCP, enabling continuous adaptation to user needs.

9. **Task Completion with Ease**: Once a task is completed, Cline presents results with simple terminal commands (e.g., `open -a "Google Chrome" index.html`), which users can execute with a single click.

## Integrate with DeepSeek API

## Best practices

1. **Disable Cline's Auto Approve Feature**: It is recommended to disable Cline's Auto Approve feature when using DeepSeek to reduce resource consumption and minimize the risk of lag caused by concurrent multiple requests.

2. **Use Modified Versions of Cline**: For example, Roo-Cline or ALine. These modified versions carry relatively shorter contexts, handle requests more smoothly, and have a higher cache hit rate, which can help save API call costs.

3. **Use DeepSeek with Caution for Large Projects**: For large code projects, it is not recommended to use DeepSeek + Cline. Large projects typically carry a large amount of code context, which can significantly slow down API request processing.

4. **Switch to Other LLM Providers**: It is recommended to switch to other LLM providers when using Cline for a smoother experience.
