# Raycast Extension - Deepseek Quick Actions

Raycast is a productivity tool that allows you to control your tools with a few keystrokes. It's far more than an app launcher, it's a way to interact with your tools and data in a more efficient way. With Raycast, you can run scripts, open files, and even interact with your favorite apps without leaving your keyboard.

[Deepseek Quick Actions](https://www.raycast.com/ViGeng/deepseeker?via=ViGeng) is a Raycast extension that allows you to interact with the Deepseek API directly from Raycast. You can perform common tasks like `summarize`, `rephrase`, `fix writing`, so on.
